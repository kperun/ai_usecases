With crewAi, we can create multi agent use cases. 
Here, we create an article crew which creates and reviews articles.
For each agent, we define:
Role:Defines the agent’s function and expertise within the crew.
Goal:The individual objective that guides the agent’s decision-making.
Backstory:Provides context and personality to the agent, enriching interactions.

the Agent class describes the "traits" of the agent, i.e., its properties.
